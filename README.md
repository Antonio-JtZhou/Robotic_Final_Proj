## ðŸš€ Project Description
This project explores the application of large language models (LLMs) in robot path planning tasks. We develop a data generation module and evaluate different models, including:

- Locally fine-tuned models
- API-based inference models

## ðŸ”§ Modules Overview

- **map/**  
  This folder contains tools for generating synthetic path planning datasets with various map sizes and obstacle configurations.

- **test/**  
  This folder is used for evaluating model performance, supporting:
  - Local inference with fine-tuned models
  - Remote inference via API
  - Comparison between different models

## ðŸ”¥ Model Fine-Tuning
We use [LlamaFactory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LlamaFactory) for fine-tuning LLMs. Please refer to the official LlamaFactory repository for detailed usage and instructions.
